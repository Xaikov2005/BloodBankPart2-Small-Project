- Encapsulation demonstration in Java
- rhfactor and bloodtype are private and declared on a different class
- using setters and getters we will able to access these private variables
- using the main method, we ask the user to enter their bloodtype and rhfactor
- inputs are assigned in the setter methods
- if inputs are empty they print "O+" by default
- else, they display the output using getter methods
